Instructions for app:

1: CALIBRATION
Set calibration mode to ON, press left and right buttons to set the distance between the two markers to 1cm. Use a ruler to measure.
Set calibration mode to OFF, and balance the phone on a line on the x and y axis to find the center of mass of the phone and adjust the green arrow to it.

2:RUNNING EXPERIMENT
Spin the phone towards yourself, with the screen facing to the right. Make sure not to drop it! Black cross will show the position at the accelerometer sensor.

3:GENERAL INFORMATION
This program works by recording the x and y acceleration, alongside with the z axis gyroscope to find the radius.

a == w^2*r (centripetal acceleration definition)
sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2) == w^2*r
r == sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2)/(w^2) (re-arranging equation)

Once the radius is found, the arctan() of ay/ax gives us the angle from where to place the radius on.
Knowing the sign of the x and y accelerations helps determine which quadrant the sensor is in.

This program is assuming that the accelerometer x and y are in the same package.
